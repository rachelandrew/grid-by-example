# Grid by Example <small>simple usage examples for the CSS3 Grid Layout Module</small>

I have been writing and speaking about the CSS Grid Layout Module for some time now. In order to learn how Grid works I've put together lots of small examples, and I am publishing them here as a resource for anyone else interested in this emerging specification. 

I wanted to try and demonstrate Grid in a way that broke down the spec into smaller chunks, rather than large examples that show lots of different aspects of the specification at once. I have also posted some of the [examples I use in my presentation](examples/page-layout/), as these are simple layouts than show a few of the properties discussed in the examples at once.

If you spot any problems, have an enhancement suggestion or would like to see a certain aspect of the module explained then feel free to either submit a pull request or just drop me a line on [me@rachelandrew.co.uk](mailto:me@rachelandrew.co.uk). I'm also on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/rachelandrew">rachelandrew</a>.

In addition to my examples I have linked to other [resources and examples](/resources) and will try and keep this listing up to date. However I would welcome any additions.

	<p>A lot of the examples here were my test examples as I researched Grid for my latest book - CSS3 Layout Modules, 2nd edition. If you are interested in modern layout for the web, <a href="http://rachelandrew.co.uk/books/css3-layout-modules/">take a look at the book</a>.</p>
