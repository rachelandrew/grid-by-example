# Credits and information about this site

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and built using Jekyll. I'm using Bootstrap and the Simple Sidebar HTML Template from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com).

It's my first time using GitHub Pages so I am grateful for the tutorial by Anna Debenham, [Get Started With GitHub Pages](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/).

In one of the examples I have used some Arrow images by Jamison Wieser from [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com).

## About me

I'm Rachel Andrew - a web developer, writer and speaker based in the UK. When I'm not messing about with CSS I'm one half of the company behind the CMS [Perch](http://grabaperch.com). I've been researching Grid Layout since the early IE10 implementation. I really like it, and want other people to like it too. A lot of the research in these examples was originally for my book [CSS3 Layout Modules, 2nd edition](http://rachelandrew.co.uk/books/css3-layout-modules/) and my presentation on [CSS Grid Layout](http://rachelandrew.co.uk/presentations/css-grid).
